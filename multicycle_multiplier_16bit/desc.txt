Design a 16-bit unsigned multi-cycle multiplier module with input pins: 1-bit clock clk, reset rst, start signal start, two 16-bit signals a and b, and output pins: 32-bit product p and completion signal done. module_name is "multicycle_multiplier_16bit". input pin: clk, rst, start, a[15:0], b[15:0]. output pin: p[31:0], done.
