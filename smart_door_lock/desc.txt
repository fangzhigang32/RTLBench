Design a smart door lock controller module with inputs: 1-bit clock clk, reset rst, 4-bit password input pass, 1-bit unlock request unlock; outputs: 1-bit unlock signal open, 1-bit error signal error. When pass matches the preset password (4â€™b1010), open=1; three consecutive incorrect attempts trigger error. module_name is "smart_door_lock". input pin: clk, rst, pass[3:0], unlock. output pin: open, error.
