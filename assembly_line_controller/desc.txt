Design an industrial assembly line controller module with inputs: 1-bit clock clk, reset rst, 1-bit sensor signal sensor, 1-bit start signal start; outputs: 1-bit motor, 1-bit conveyor belt, 1-bit stop signal stop. When sensor=1, the assembly line starts; when abnormal, stop=1. module_name is "assembly_line_controller". input pin: clk, rst, sensor, start. output pin: motor, belt, stop.
