Design a taxi meter module with inputs: 1-bit clock clk, reset rst, 1-bit start signal start, stop signal stop, 1-bit distance pulse dist_pulse, and outputs: fare, running status running. The fare rule is a starting price of 500 cents (within 2 kilometers), with an additional 100 cents per kilometer. When start=1, fare calculation begins, running=1, and initial fare=500; when stop=1, fare calculation stops, running=0. For each dist_pulse received (representing 1 kilometer), if the distance exceeds 2 kilometers, fare increases by 100 cents. When rst=1, the system resets with fare=0 and running=0. module_name is "simple_taxi_meter". input pins: clk, rst, start, stop, dist_pulse. output pins: fare[15:0], running.
