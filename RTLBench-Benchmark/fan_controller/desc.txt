Design a smart fan controller module with inputs: 1-bit clock clk, reset rst, 8-bit temperature value temp, 8-bit threshold thresh, and outputs: 1-bit fan switch fan_on, 2-bit fan speed speed. When temp > thresh, fan_on=1, and the speed is set based on the difference between temp and thresh (00: low speed, 01: medium speed, 10: high speed). When rst=1, the fan is turned off. module_name is "fan_controller". input pin: clk, rst, temp[7:0], thresh[7:0]. output pin: fan_on, speed[1:0].
