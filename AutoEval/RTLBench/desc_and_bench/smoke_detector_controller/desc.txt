Design a smart smoke alarm module with inputs: 1-bit clock clk, reset rst, 1-bit smoke sensor smoke, 1-bit disarm signal disarm, and outputs: 1-bit alarm signal alarm, 1-bit warning signal warning. When smoke=1 persists for 5 clock cycles, warning=1; when it persists for 10 cycles, alarm=1. All outputs are cleared when disarm=1. module_name is "smoke_detector_controller". input pin: clk, rst, smoke, disarm. output pin: alarm, warning.
