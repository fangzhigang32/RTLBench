Design a telephone billing module with inputs: 1-bit clock clk, reset rst, 1-bit call start signal start, call end signal stop, and outputs: cost, call status active. Billing rules: Charge 30 cents per minute (60 seconds), with any fraction of a minute rounded up to a full minute. When start=1, billing begins, active=1, initial cost=30 (first-minute fee); every 60 seconds, cost increases by 30 cents. When stop=1, billing stops, active=0, cost remains unchanged. When rst=1, reset occurs, cost=0, active=0. module_name is "phone_billing". input pin: clk, rst, start, stop. output pin: cost[15:0], active.
